## Basic formulae for value of a commodity

- Value = c + v + s

- c = constant capital
    - capital goods
    - Refers to the material goods that go into production (buildings, machinery, raw materials, energy)
    - if you keep breaking down c you'd end up with only labor inputs

- v = labor inputs
    - values of the goods that are necessary to reproduce the worker's capacity to work a given nÂ° of hours
    - food needed to consume
    - medical care, etc

- s = surplus value
    - differential between the total amount of value produced by the worker in a work day and the value of the worker's labor power (avg wage)
